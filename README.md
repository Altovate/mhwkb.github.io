## Warning About Discontinuing Medication
Please note: doctors recommend that no one should attempt to withdrawal
from psychiatric drugs (Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety drugs
and ADHD drugs) without a doctor's supervision. If you have firmly decided to
discontinue medication without a doctor's supervision, you can find some guides
to medication withdrawal (a.k.a. [_discontinuation syndrome_](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-discontinuation-syndrome/)) on book-selling sites, or sites such as [The Icarus Project](http://theicarusproject.net/).
